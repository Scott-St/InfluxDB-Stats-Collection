# InfluxDB-Stats-Collection
Scripts I am using on my network to collect data for InfluxDB.  
These are specific to my network but in case anyone wants to disect them, feel free.

- Ensure you change the username/password in the scripts.  This is just a default.  It is not required by default on InfluxDB.
- Change the path to your InfluxDB server.

###Scripts for:
- unRAID
- Windows Server DNS
- Windows PCs
- DD-WRT Router
